Dataset and Preprocessing

The dataset comprises MRI images of ovaries, which are used to train the deep learning model. Preprocessing steps include resizing and data augmentation to address the limited size of the dataset and improve the model's generalization capabilities .


Model Architecture

The DenseNet121 model is employed as the base architecture, chosen for its dense connectivity pattern that ensures maximum information flow between layers in the network . The model is initialized with weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, with the top classification layers excluded to allow for customization to the PCOS detection task.


Following the base model, a global average pooling layer is introduced to condense the feature maps into a single vector, reducing the number of parameters and preventing overfitting . Subsequently, a series of fully-connected layers with 1024, 512, 256, and 128 neurons are added, all utilizing the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity and aid in learning complex patterns in the data .


The final layer is a logistic layer with a sigmoid activation function, specifically designed for binary classification. This layer outputs a probability score indicating the likelihood of PCOS presence in the MRI image .


Model Compilation

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, a popular choice for deep learning tasks due to its adaptive learning rate capabilities. The learning rate is set to 0.0001 to ensure gradual and stable convergence during training. Binary cross-entropy is selected as the loss function, suitable for binary classification problems, and accuracy is used as the metric to evaluate the model's performance .


Results

The proposed DenseNet121 model for PCOS detection from MRI images is a novel application of deep learning in the medical field. While the model's performance has not been directly reported in this research, similar architectures have achieved high accuracy in related tasks, such as the PCONet with an accuracy of 98.12% . The fusion of clinical data with ultrasound images in other studies has also shown the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy .


Discussion

The application of deep learning models like DenseNet121 for PCOS detection from MRI images represents a significant advancement in the field of medical diagnostics. The model's architecture is designed to effectively learn from complex image data, potentially reducing the burden on healthcare professionals and improving diagnostic accuracy . However, further research and validation on larger datasets are necessary to fully establish the model's efficacy in clinical settings.


Conclusion

This research report outlines the development of a DenseNet121-based deep learning model for the detection of PCOS from MRI images. The model's architecture, which includes a pre-trained DenseNet121 base, additional fully-connected layers, and a logistic layer with a sigmoid activation function, is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. The model holds promise as a diagnostic tool for PCOS, with the potential to improve accuracy and efficiency in medical diagnostics.
